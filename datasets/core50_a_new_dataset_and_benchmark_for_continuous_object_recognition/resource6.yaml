    "title": "CoRe50: A new Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition",
    "description": "CORe50, specifically designed for (C)ontinuous (O)bject (Re)cognition, is a collection of 50 domestic objects belonging to 10 categories: plug adapters, mobile phones, scissors, light bulbs, cans, glasses, balls, markers, cups and remote controls. Classification can be performed at object level (50 classes) or at category level (10 classes). The first task (the default one) is much more challenging because objects of the same category are very difficult to be distinguished under certain poses.",
